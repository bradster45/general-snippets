#### Publication filters

[Date filters](https://github.com/bradster45/general-snippets/blob/master/datetime_filters.py) are some useful examples of filtering using Django's DateTimeField. Examples include:
- Total count and count per day of objects from a provided date until the current date
- Total and per day count of objects from a set number of days ago to the current date
- Number of objects published per date from a set number of days ago to the current date
- Number of objects published per day from a set number of days ago to the current date
